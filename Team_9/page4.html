                        screening and treatment for conditions like high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes
                        care for minor symptoms, such as sore throat, cough, or nasal congestion
                        treatment for common illnesses like colds, the flu, or urinary tract infections (UTIs)
                        treatment of some injuries, such as minor cuts or burns

                        Rural health clinics provide medically necessary primary or preventive care. A service is considered medically necessary if it’s required to either diagnose or treat an illness or condition.
                        
                        If the clinic doesn’t offer a specific service, the clinic staff may be able to arrange for you to receive medically necessary care at a hospital or specialized clinic.</h3>
