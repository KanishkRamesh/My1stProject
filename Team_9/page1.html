                        The average person needs about 2,000 calories every day to maintain their weight, but the amount will depend on their age, sex, and physical activity level.
                        
                        Males tend to need more calories than females, and people who exercise need more calories than people who don’t.</h3>

                        Children who don’t get enough healthy foods may face growth and developmental problems, poor academic performance, and frequent infections.
                        
                        They can also develop unhealthy eating habits that may persist into adulthood.
                        
                        Without exercise, they’ll also have a higher risk of obesity and various diseases that make up metabolic syndrome, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.</h3>

                    <h3>Whether your goal is weight loss, increased health, or a more natural way of life, checking in with your doctor before beginning the fruit diet is a good idea. This diet may have an adverse effect on your overall health if you have an underlying medical condition or take any medications. Your doctor can help you understand your individual risks and help you modify the diet to suit your needs.

                        Meeting with a registered dietitian is also a good idea. They can help create a plan that works for you while also ensuring you have no nutritional gaps.</h3>
